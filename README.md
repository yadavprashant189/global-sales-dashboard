# global-sales-dashboard
This is a dashboard created in Microsoft Power BI, a business intelligence tool. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

The dataset that has been used here is the global superstore data of 2016, which has categorised data into different regions of the world, which comes in very handy when visualising data.

The blue bubbles shown in the above map are the regions of the world and the bubble size denotes the relative amount of sales in a particular region. 

## Data cleaning

A bit of data cleaning and preprocessing went into making this dashboard, as the 'People' and 'Returns' tables were not in a proper format. There the column headers needed to be changed using the following tool :

## Selection

After the cleaning was done, it was a matter of exploration of the business intelligence tool in order to make the dashboard as interactive and interesting as possible. In order to allow the user to know the advancements in terms of time, a slicer was added and the bar graphs have a feature of highlighting the information of the bar that has been selected. Have a look as I select the highest profit making product:

Overall, it was fun maing this dashboard and learning about BI.
